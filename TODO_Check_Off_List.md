- [ ]    NEW: Watch the Connecting to the Database (IntelliJ) or Connecting to the Database (NetBeans) webinar to learn how to connect to the Database from IntelliJ or NetBeans within the Virtual Machine (VM)
     
- [ ]    NEW: Watch the Connecting to the Database (MySQL Workbench) webinar to learn how to connect to the Database from MySQL Workbench within the Virtual Machine (VM)
     
- [ ]    Watch the Getting You DBConnection Class Project Ready. This webinar recording is also available in Course Tips under the same title. Please note that the webinar shows connecting to an older database so the IP address, database name, and password differ from the VM database connections so please watch the webinars on Connecting to the Database (IntelliJ) or Connecting to the Database (NetBeans) first.
     
- [ ]    Watch the JDBC  API Webinar to learn how to use its implementations to work with MySQL from Java and perform CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE (CRUD) operations on data.
     
- [ ]    Examine the ERD
     
- [ ]    Optionally Sign up to lucidchart.com  to create UML Class Diagrams
     
- [ ]    Define POJO (Plain Old Java Object) classes that Map the ERD. The POJOs are used to Map rows from the database tables
     
- [ ]    Organize your project to include the packages; model, controller, dao, and helper. The model package will hold your POJOs. The controller package will hold Controller classes that contain Business Logic for your views. The dao package will hold Utility Classes that handle Database Access. And the helper package will hold helper classes that handle tasks such as Date / Time processing, List management, etc.
     
- [ ]    Place your view files (FXML documents) in the resources directory (if using a Maven JavaFX project) or in a view package

Part IV: Classes

- [ ]    In your IDE (Integrated Development Environment), define Classes and Functional Interfaces illustrated in your UML Class diagram and organize them using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design architecture. Add a utility or utils package to hold classes for your; Database Connection, Query Execution, Collection (ObservarbleArrayList) Management, Functional Interfaces, and time conversion files. (Watch the C195 Organizing Your Code webinar recording). Defining DAO or Abstract classes with static methods that perform CRUD (Create Read Update Delete)  or INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations is highly recommended. For more info on the DAO pattern, visit this link: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/data_access_object_pattern.htm and also watch the LinkedIn Learning course titled Learning JDBC by Frank P Moley III
